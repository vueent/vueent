# Getting started

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D @vueent/<package_name>
```

VueenT consists of three independent parts that can be used separately:

- [`@vueent/reactive`](../reactive/guide/) - typescript decorators which allows to use `ref` and `computed` properties transparently inside of classes
- [`@vueent/core`](../core/guide/) - a small library that integrates controllers and services patterns to the application
- [`@vueent/mix-models`](../mix-models/guide/) - a library that provides reactive models classes for _nosql_ models with optionally saving, rollback and live validations
